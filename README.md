---
Small project to improve my automation skills.

## Points of interest:
- Remember install ```behave``` using the following command: ```pip install selenium behave``` if you don't have it  
- To start the robot, you need to use the following command: ```behave``` in your terminal.
- To use the robot you need to set your own url and settings for the page you want to use. Using a config.json file like this:
```json
{
  "url": "www.your_url.com",
  "username": "your_username", -> if you need it 
  "password": "your_password" -> if you need it 
}
```
